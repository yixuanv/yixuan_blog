It is the national holiday that Zijia and I decide to take the trip to Chicago. We choose Chicago because it is not far from Cincinnati (since we only have four days) and it is the third biggest city in the U.S. We didn't book the hotel and bus early. What left us for the choices of hotels are either the expensive one near downtown center or some relatively not so upgraded neighbourhood but cheaper. We finally chose one and then found out that it was in the black community.ðŸ˜¢

BUT luckily, when we arrived, we felt relief. Our landlord Marcus is a kind, polite white man. There are also three cute dogs in his house.
